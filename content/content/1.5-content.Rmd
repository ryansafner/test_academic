# <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Solving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the *dynamics* of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally *respond* to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. 

An individual’s **demand function** (often just called **“demand”**) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one's demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person's quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of *other* goods, and the person's income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good's price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar **demand curve** you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.

Today, we look only at how changes in *income* or changes in the prices of *other* goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.

In doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an *elasticity.* You've seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the "midpoint formula." There's a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.

Today we will be working on [practice problems](/practice/1.6-practice). Answers will be posted later on that page.
