<h2>Using an App on Your Phone</h2>
<p>There are many good apps out there that will allow you to take photos and convert them to PDFs. <strong>This is actually a <em>better</em> method</strong> than using your computer (described below), since theses apps optimize your photos for PDFs (using your computer to convert will often result in very large PDF file sizes!). Here are a few apps you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://evernote.com/products/scannable">Scannable <i class="fab fa-apple"></i></a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innover.imagetopdf&amp;hl=en_US">Image to PDF Converter Free <i class="fab fa-android"></i></a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twansoftware.pdfconverterpro&amp;hl=en_US">PDF Converter Pro <i class="fab fa-android"></i></a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-scanner-doc-scan-app-for-scanning-document-as/id1035256307">Simple Scan <i class="fab fa-apple"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I use Scannable â€” primarily because of its association with Evernote, if you wanted a recommendation. But note it does not exist on Android. I also have successfully used Turboscan in the past.</p>
<p>Additionally, as Hood students, you all have <strong>Onedrive</strong>, you can use the app on your phone to scan documents with photos and convert them to PDFs.</p>

<h2>Using Images Sent to Your Computer</h2>
<p>Most modern versions of operating system have a built-in tool in the File Viewer (or Finder) menus, after clicking on one or multiple files, to create a PDF from the files.</p>
<p>So first take photos on your smartphone of your written work (one photo per page). <strong>Please try to frame your photos properly!</strong> Put your paper flat on a solid surface (table, desk, the floor, etc). Get the whole page within the borders of the photo, and not too much background. I donâ€™t need to see half of your desk or bed as you are taking the photo! Take a look at it and make sure it is legible.</p>
<p>Next, get the photos onto your computer (whether by Airdrop, email to yourself, Dropbox, etc.). Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:</p>
<p><strong>1. On a Windows PC</strong></p>
<p>Open the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select <code>Print</code>. In the dialog box that pops up, select <code>Microsoft Print to PDF</code> in the <code>Printer</code> box, and then click <code>Print.</code> This will save it as a <code>.pdf</code> file in that folder. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/361612/how-to-create-a-pdf-file-in-windows/">See more information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. On a Mac</strong></p>
<p>As I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action. I have written two pages in a notebook and taken two separate pictures of them, and airdropped them onto my computer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/photos_to_pdf2.png" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/photos_to_pdf3.png" /></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="../files/photos_to_pdf.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> example PDF</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. On Linux</strong></p>
<p>If you use Linux, I assume you know your way around a computer well enough to make a PDF! ðŸ¤–</p>
